# Sears edit of APEX Calculus

This is a fork of the LaTeX code for the APEX Calculus book.

I am interested in developing Calculus I and Calculus II classes using OER materials.
I liked the exercise sets in the APEX Calculus text, and decided to borrow the whole text. 
I will be cleaning up the repository and adapting the LaTeX code to suit my purposes.
I plan to add materials and homework excercises from YouTube and the OpenStax Calculus books.

## Changelog

2020-02-27:
1. Forked the main repository.
2. Wrote a Makefile to compile on my Linux Mint system.
On quick inspection, the results are page-to-page similar.

## The original README.md follows:

Source files for the APEX Calculus text, Version 4.0.

The main file is Calculus.tex, intended to be run with XeLaTeX with the Calibri font. It will run without Calibri and with pdflatex, but the spacing will be different than intended. One can try using the Carlito font, which is an open font with (supposedly) the same font metrics as Calibri. I have not yet tried it personally.

CalculusI, CalculusII, CalculusIII and CalculusIII_star each typeset a portion of the text.

The content of APEX Calc, V4.0 is now fixed. Adjustments may be made to this repository in the future as different forms/formats of the text are created, but the core content itself is now fixed.

Enjoy.
